# intro
This repository contains code and documentation for understanding and implementing different types of nodes in a blockchain network for the purpose of participating in airdrop projects. A node is a fundamental unit within a blockchain network, primarily responsible for distributing data among other nodes in the network. Nodes store a copy of the entire blockchain data and add blocks with new transactions based on the consensus mechanism. By setting up nodes, participants can be eligible to receive airdrops distributed by blockchain projects.

# Type Nodes
1. Full Nodes (Masternodes)
Full nodes are fully synchronized with the blockchain network and store the complete history of the network since its inception. They play a crucial role in maintaining the security and integrity of the blockchain. If the consensus rules are violated in a transaction or block, a full node rejects the operation, even if all other nodes accept it.

# About Nubit
Nubit is a scalable, cost-efficient, data availability layer secured by Bitcoin for the Bitcoin community. Nubit enables the scaling of Bitcoin's data capacities, empowering applications like Ordinals, Layer 2s, and price oracles, thus broadening the scope and efficiency of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

# Hardware Requirements
The hardware requirements for a Light Node are quite low:
- 1 core CPU
- 500 MB RAM
- 40 GB storage
- 0.1 Mbps connection
